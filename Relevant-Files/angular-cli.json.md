# angular-cli.json

This is the **Angular-CLI** configuration file.

In this file, the developer can customize somethings like:

+ Which stylesheet file is used in the application
+ Which script files are used in the application

The `angular-cli.json` also specifies which are the **index** and the **main** files, as well as the **prefix** (which is used to avoid name conflict when using other external components), and also some **test** configuration for the app.
